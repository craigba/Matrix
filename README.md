Matrix Multiplication

Developers: Byron A. Craig & Ryan Robertson
Institution: James Madison University, 2013

Description:
------------

To run the C file you must use 'gcc' to compile and execute. This file when run takes an input file and fills a
2D matrix with number from that input file. Another 2D matrix is also filled and then both of the matrices are
then multiplied to get an output matrix as a result. All three matrices including the result is sent to an output
file which can be viewed in the directory.

Issues:
-------

- None So Far :)
